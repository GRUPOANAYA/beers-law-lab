- buttons fire on 'up' event even if they haven't seen a 'down' event
- disable (instead of hide) increment/decrement buttons for sliders (not supported by sun.Button)
- add relativePressPoint to MovableDragHandler, so that mouse doesn't get away from drag target
- improve drag handler for faucet handles
