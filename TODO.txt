TODO list for beers-law-lab (HTML5 port)

DESIGN ISSUES

BUGS
- Safari 5: text bounds are very wrong, scenery#61
- iPad: open About dialog, sim starts to scale down
- Nexus: big part of play area is not visible
- Nexus: performance
- Desktop: HTMLText dragging lags on Mac+Firefox, eg label on shaker, joist#5

HIGH
- draw shaker particles directly to Canvas
- add relativePressPoint to MovableDragHandler, so that mouse doesn't get away from drag target

MEDIUM
- change to LinearFunction(a1,b1,a2,b2,clamp), support var f = LinearFunction(...), f(5), f.inverse(2), migrate to dot
- make radio buttons on AT detector larger
- disable (instead of hide) increment/decrement buttons for sliders (not supported by sun.Button)
- improve drag handler for faucet lever

LOW
- delete unused faucet variants and associated image files
- replace Property.set/get with Property.value
- update to latest version of lib/ dependencies, including jQuery 2.x
- ComboBox: remove enableClickToDismissListener, workaround for scenery#58
- generalize left/right arrow buttons for sliders
- lighting on AT body is vertically flipped, graphic is not tall enough for larger radio buttons
- nicer slider thumbs
- value in concentration meter jitters horizontally as value changes
- split faucet_lever.png into 2 images, so that only the knob is interactive?
- use scenery.Pattern to texture map input pipe in FaucetNode
- get new images for faucet, faucet_pipe.png doesn't match up with faucet_spigot.png
