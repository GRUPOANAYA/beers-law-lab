TODO list for beers-law-lab (HTML5 port)

DESIGN ISSUES
- tablet usability issues from 1/29/13 notebook
- interactive components feel too small on Nexus

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
- UI components (radio buttons, combo box, sliders)

SCENERY BUGS
- text that is supposed to be invisible is visible when switching tabs, eg "Saturate!" (scenery#25)

SCENERY ENHANCEMENTS

BUGS
- iPad, Nexus: bootstrap components look like they respond but do nothing (all except "Reset All" button)
- iPad, Nexus: performance of particles
- iPad: unresponsive when concentration probe is dragged into solution, ditto for AT detector (text performance?)
- iPad: resizing the cuvette is painfully sluggish
- iPad: text doesn't keep up with dragging (e.g., on shaker)
- iPad: wavelength slider is unusable and thumb disappears

HIGH
- resize height of wavelength control panel based on whether slider is visible (scenery bounds bug?)
- solution combo box
- concentration slider
- rewrite combo box in scenery

MEDIUM
- better spectrum for wavelength slider track
- disable (instead of hide) +/- buttons in wavelength slider
- better +/- buttons for sliders
- prevent dropper from being dragged by on/off button
- add relativePressPoint to MovableDragHandler, so that mouse doesn't get away from drag target
- use ImagesLoader to load images, delete images.js in config.js
- improve drag handler for faucet handles

LOW
- Grunt file
- nicer knob for evaporation slider
- value in concentration meter jitters horizontally as value changes
- split faucet_handle.png into 2 images, so that only the knob is interactive?
- use scenery.Pattern to texture map input pipe in FaucetNode
- use scenery.Font for font specification
- get new images for faucet, faucet_pipe.png doesn't match up with faucet_spigot.png
- factor out commonality in MomentaryButtonNode and ToggleButtonNode, migrate to sun?

LOWEST
- add missing assets (.ai) for faucet
