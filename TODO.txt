TODO list for beers-law-lab (HTML5 port)

DESIGN ISSUES
- tablet usability issues from 1/29/13 notebook
- interactive components feel too small on Nexus

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
- UI components (radio buttons, combo box, sliders)

SCENERY BUGS
- iPad: Text node performance is not usable for dynamic text (scenery#16)
- iPad: "Drink mix" text on shaker is broken into 2 lines, text moves separate from shaker, ditto for dropper (scenery#13)
- in SoluteControlsNode, setting font "32px Arial" for soluteLabel results in Node.invalidateSelf assertion failure (scenery#22)

SCENERY ENHANCEMENTS

BUGS
- iPad, Nexus: bootstrap components look like they respond but do nothing (all except "Reset All" button)
- iPad, Nexus: performance of particles

HIGH
- handle click offset for thumb in wavelength slider and evaporation slider
- text that is supposed to be invisible is visible when switching tabs (eg, "Saturate!")
- resize height of wavelength control panel based on whether slider is visible (scenery bounds bug?)
- ruler
- solution combo box
- concentration slider
- rewrite combo box in scenery

MEDIUM
- better spectrum for wavelength slider track
- disable (instead of hide) +/- buttons in wavelength slider
- better +/- buttons for sliders
- prevent dropper from being dragged by on/off button
- layout of almost all text is inaccurate
- dynamic text leaves trails (AT detector value)
- use scenery's new coordinate frame transform methods (scenery#12)
- add relativePressPoint for drag handlers, so that mouse doesn't get away from drag target
- use ImagesLoader to load images, delete images.js in config.js
- compute deltaSeconds in animation loop
- improve drag handler for faucet handles
- split faucet_handle.png into 2 images, so that only the knob is interactive?

LOW
- Grunt file
- nicer knob for evaporation slider
- value in concentration meter jitters horizontally as value changes
- use scenery.Pattern to texture map input pipe in FaucetNode
- use scenery.Font for font specification
- get new images for faucet, faucet_pipe.png doesn't match up with faucet_spigot.png
- factor out commonality in MomentaryButtonNode and ToggleButtonNode, migrate to sun?

LOWEST
- add missing assets (.ai) for faucet
