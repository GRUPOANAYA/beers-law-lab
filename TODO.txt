HIGH

MEDIUM
- use scenery's new coordinate frame transform methods (scenery#12)

- use ImagesLoader to load images, delete images.js in config.js
- compute deltaSeconds in animation loop
- improve drag handler for faucet handles
- split faucet_handle.png into 2 images, so that only the knob is interactive?
