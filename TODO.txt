SCENERY BUGS

SCENERY ENHANCEMENTS

BUGS
- Nexus: big part of play area is not visible
- iPad, Nexus: performance of particles
- iPad: unresponsive when concentration probe is dragged into solution, ditto for AT detector (text performance?)
- iPad: resizing the cuvette is painfully sluggish
- iPad: text doesn't keep up with dragging (e.g., on shaker)
- iPad: wavelength slider is unusable and thumb disappears

HIGH
- bug: shaker particles move up before falling (broken by scenery changes?)
- bug: combo box list only receives events every-other time it's popped up
- bug: wavelength control panel doesn't resize when wavelength control is removed
- laundry list at top of ComboBoxNode

MEDIUM
- buttons fire on 'up' event even if they haven't seen a 'down' event
- disable (instead of hide) increment/decrement buttons for sliders (not supported by sun.Button)
- add relativePressPoint to MovableDragHandler, so that mouse doesn't get away from drag target
- improve drag handler for faucet handles

LOW
- generalize left/right arrow buttons for sliders
- lighting on AT body is vertically flipped, graphic is not tall enough
- sim resizing doesn't play nice with browser zoom features
- nicer slider thumbs
- value in concentration meter jitters horizontally as value changes
- split faucet_handle.png into 2 images, so that only the knob is interactive?
- use scenery.Pattern to texture map input pipe in FaucetNode
- replace bll.Color with scenery.Color
- use scenery.Font for font specification
- get new images for faucet, faucet_pipe.png doesn't match up with faucet_spigot.png
- factor out commonality in MomentaryButtonNode and ToggleButtonNode, migrate to sun?
