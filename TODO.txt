TODO list for beers-law-lab (HTML5 port)

DESIGN ISSUES

BUGS

- text quality issues, beers-law-lab#1

HIGH
- draw shaker particles directly to Canvas
- MovableDragHandler: cursor drifts slightly during drag, mvt is not the same as scenery's global coordinate frame

MEDIUM
- use same (rectangle?) thumb for Evaporation and Concentration sliders

LOW
- update to latest version of lib/ dependencies, including jQuery 2.x
- use scenery.Pattern to texture map input pipe in FaucetNode
