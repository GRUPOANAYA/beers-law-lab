- Desktop: HTML text dragging lags on Mac+Firefox, joist#5

HIGH
- dynamically resize wavelength control panel, scenery#45

MEDIUM
- ComboBoxNode: use listNode.visible instead of addChild/removeChild(listNode)
- ComboBoxNode: click outside of list to dismiss it
- ComboBoxNode: support for listParent (and coordinate-frame transforms this requires)
- make radio buttons on AT detector larger
- buttons fire on 'up' event even if they haven't seen a 'down' event
- disable (instead of hide) increment/decrement buttons for sliders (not supported by sun.Button)
- add relativePressPoint to MovableDragHandler, so that mouse doesn't get away from drag target
- improve drag handler for faucet handles

LOW

- sim resizing doesn't play nice with browser zoom features

- split faucet_handle.png into 2 images, so that only the knob is interactive?
- use scenery.Pattern to texture map input pipe in FaucetNode
- use scenery.Font for font specification
- get new images for faucet, faucet_pipe.png doesn't match up with faucet_spigot.png
