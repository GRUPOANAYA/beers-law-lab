TODO list for beers-law-lab (HTML5 port)

DESIGN ISSUES

BUGS
- Safari 5: text bounds are very wrong, scenery#61
- Nexus: performance, usability
- Desktop: HTMLText dragging lags on Mac+Firefox, eg label on shaker, joist#5

HIGH
- draw shaker particles directly to Canvas
- MovableDragHandler: cursor drifts slightly during drag, mvt is not the same as scenery's global coordinate frame

MEDIUM
- make radio buttons on AT detector larger
- disable (instead of hide) increment/decrement buttons for sliders (not supported by sun.Button)
- improve drag handler for faucet lever

LOW
- delete unused faucet variants and associated image files
- update to latest version of lib/ dependencies, including jQuery 2.x
- ComboBox: remove enableClickToDismissListener, workaround for scenery#58
- generalize left/right arrow buttons for sliders
- lighting on AT body is vertically flipped, graphic is not tall enough for larger radio buttons
- nicer slider thumbs
- split faucet_lever.png into 2 images, so that only the knob is interactive?
- use scenery.Pattern to texture map input pipe in FaucetNode
- get new images for faucet, faucet_pipe.png doesn't match up with faucet_spigot.png
- Credits: Ariel (lead), Chris (dev), Noah P, Emily, Kathy, Julia
- TODO items throughout code

LOWEST
- replace Property.set/get with Property.value
