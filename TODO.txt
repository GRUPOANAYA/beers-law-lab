SCENERY BUGS

SCENERY ENHANCEMENTS

BUGS
- iPad: concentration probe becomes stuck when dragged into solution and other parts of sim become unresponsive
- iPad: "Drink mix" text on shaker is broken into 2 lines, text moves separate from shaker, ditto for dropper (scenery#13)
- iPad, Nexus: bootstrap components look like they respond but do nothing (all except "Reset All" button)
- iPad, Nexus: performance of particles

HIGH
- try Fort
- create a dropdown node without bootstrap
- finish SoluteDropdownNode
- CSS for bootstrap components

MEDIUM
- use scenery's new coordinate frame transform methods (scenery#12)
- add relativePressPoint for drag handlers, so that mouse doesn't get away from drag target
- nicer knob for evaporation slider
- gradient in evaporation slider track
- use ImagesLoader to load images, delete images.js in config.js
- compute deltaSeconds in animation loop
- improve drag handler for faucet handles
- split faucet_handle.png into 2 images, so that only the knob is interactive?
- prevent dropper from being dragged by on/off button
- Beer's Law module

LOW
- load bootstrap and bootstrap-dropdown via config.js
- value in concentration meter jitters horizontally as value changes
- use scenery.Pattern to texture map input pipe in FaucetNode
- use scenery.Font for font specification
- get new images for faucet, faucet_pipe.png doesn't match up with faucet_spigot.png

LOWEST
- add missing assets (.ai) for faucet
