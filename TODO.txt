TODO list for beers-law-lab (HTML5 port)

DESIGN ISSUES

BUGS
- Safari 5: text bounds are very wrong, scenery#61
- iPad: open About dialog, sim starts to scale down
- Nexus: big part of play area is not visible
- Nexus: performance
- Desktop: HTML text dragging lags on Mac+Firefox, joist#5

HIGH
- faucet version with slider
- faucet version with pinball shooter
- draw shaker particles directly to Canvas
- selecting from "Solute" combo box also presses radio buttons behind it
- buttons fire on 'up' event even if they haven't seen a 'down' event
- dropper can be dragged by button, fix this without using event.handle
- add relativePressPoint to MovableDragHandler, so that mouse doesn't get away from drag target
- improve drag handler for faucet handles

MEDIUM
- replace LinearFunction with dot.Util.linear
- make radio buttons on AT detector larger
- disable (instead of hide) increment/decrement buttons for sliders (not supported by sun.Button)

LOW
- update to latest version of lib/ dependencies, including jQuery 2.x
- beers-law-lab.css: delete CSS for browser window borders, workaround for joist#6
- ComboBox: remove enableClickToDismissListener, workaround for scenery#58
- generalize left/right arrow buttons for sliders
- lighting on AT body is vertically flipped, graphic is not tall enough for larger radio buttons
- nicer slider thumbs
- value in concentration meter jitters horizontally as value changes
- split faucet_handle.png into 2 images, so that only the knob is interactive?
- use scenery.Pattern to texture map input pipe in FaucetNode
- get new images for faucet, faucet_pipe.png doesn't match up with faucet_spigot.png
- factor out commonality in MomentaryButtonNode and ToggleButtonNode, migrate to sun?
